* Update of README : Presentation , content  and  recover the existing readme that has been overwritten at iteration number one

* Continue research and testing in order to find a solution allowing the connection to Microsoft 365 and the creation of an Excel file and writing in this same file ( the https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/dep-git-Teach_spreadsheets/blob/84afed94d42b61258a8e9819fc65781796ec903e/Doc/Doc_Excel_Api.adoc[Tutorial to create a sheet online] on the branch https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/dep-git-Teach_spreadsheets/tree/dev_samba_nael[dev_samba_nael] can possibly be reused)

*Team 2 : Mohammed A & Elena*

TO DO :

* Implementation of the proposed changes and improvement of the class diagrams started on the branch dev_Mohamed_x2 (https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/dep-git-Teach_spreadsheets/blob/32141a63acb93246a15d8be48ce75bcdd8314ab7/Doc/Images/Base%20classes%20modified.png[Modification of class diagrams "Base classes"]) for the task : "the application displays the difference between the total of hours desired and the total of hours assigned. The total of hours assigned are gathered for every teacher for every cell where he appears” (Voir PR #2). So the new branch will be created from this branch https://github.com/oliviercailloux-org/dep-git-Teach_spreadsheets/tree/dev_Mohamed_x2 and have to be named : Difference_hoursDesired_hoursAssigned-it2

* Sequence diagram  as proposed by Mr Cailloux (At PR #2 's review)
